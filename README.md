# webdevarc
This repository contains my web development ventures.

# What is the Deal
This repository represents my deep dive into the world of web development. It will be filled with various projects and mini-projects, and my goal is to explore as many aspects as possible to become a proficient web developer.

# How I will use this
This repository serves as a platform for learning web development and expanding my skills in this field. I'll be using a variety of tools and programming languages. Additionally, coding often involves recurring patterns, and this repository will store code that I can refer to for future web projects.

# XAMPP 
I will also do some php development with XAMPP. With these projects I will simply take the code in the folder and copy it to the proper folder on my own local machine

# Ordinary
Whether big or small, high or low, this marks the beginning of my journey. I'm still relatively a beginner and aspire to enhance my skills in the world of web applications. I won't dive too deep just yet. The training wheels are on to an extent.
